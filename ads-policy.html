    <h1>Advertising & Data Collection Practices</h1>

    <h2>1. Third-Party Advertising</h2>
    <p>
      We work with several advertising partners to deliver contextual ads within our app. Our primary networks include IronSource Mediation, Unity Ads, and AdMob. Their policies and documentation are provided via links shown above.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection for Advertising</h2>
    <p>
      For the purpose of serving and optimizing ads, our app collects only the essential data, which includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device ID</li>
      <li>Advertising Data</li>
      <li>Product Interaction</li>
      <li>Performance Data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      No additional data is gathered beyond what is necessary for advertising.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing Practices</h2>
    <p>
      The information collected is shared exclusively to support our advertising efforts, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Other Advertising Partners: To enable competitive bidding on ad inventory.</li>
      <li>Corporate Affiliates: In line with our privacy policy requirements.</li>
      <li>App Developers: For attribution, whitelisting/blacklisting, and reporting purposes.</li>
      <li>Service Providers: To assist with fraud detection, viewability measurement, reporting, and secure data storage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Further details on our data sharing practices can be found via the links shown above.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Ad Creative and Content Safeguards</h2>
    <p>
      All ad creatives are subject to a human review process—either conducted internally or through our advertising partners—to ensure that all content meets our strict standards for age appropriateness.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are committed to maintaining transparency and ensuring that our advertising practices prioritize your privacy while delivering a quality user experience.
